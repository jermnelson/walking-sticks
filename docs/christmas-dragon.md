# Christmas Dragon Walking Stick 
## 001

## Beginnings
The gensis of the *Christmas Dragon* walking stick was in January 2019 when 
I was taking down the family's Christmas Tree. I was breaking down the tree
by removing all of the branches into our main outside composter and I ended
up with the trunk that was surprisingly straight and a nice piece of wood.
I was reluctent to chop up the trunk and decided to turn it into a walking
stick as the height was about perfect at least for my height of 5 foot 7
inches.  

Here is an early photo of *Christmas Dragon*:

## First sketches
Thinking of what I would want from a walking stick, I realized
a very useful feature would be a compass to assist in navigating when 
hiking. 

## Preparation
I started by taking the rough piece of wood, and using my file rasp I gradually 
removed all of the bark over the last nine months of 2019.
